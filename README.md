A new Flutter application which is basically a slightly more complex counter... originally for testing the waters with [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) to learn how to migrate from [ScopedModel](https://pub.dev/packages/scoped_model)!

## Style

A slightly different style is used to a default Material Design app, but a DraggableScrollableSheet is used to a similar design to a Youtube Music BottomSheet.
